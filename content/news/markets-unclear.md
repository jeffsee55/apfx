## Overview

Today will be the second day of testimony to Congress by the official who insists that the economy is not on a hot streak and that prices are rising but will not stay there nor keep growing at that pace. What is interesting about his determination is that it comes at a time when other central banks are starting to consider a more hawkish approach, so the recovery is less dependent on loose monetary policy. Additionally, investors are concerned that the record highs in equity valuations could come crashing as overall the economy seems to have lost the momentum of the first quarter.

Nevertheless, this morning’s survey of New York’s Empire Manufacturing revealed a record reading of optimism among suppliers, so some regions are flying while others struggle. Initial Jobless Claims, for example, increased more than expected for the start of July. Meanwhile, other Fed officials are feeling like they need to express disagreement with Powell, as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard believes the economy has reached “substantial further progress,” meaning it is time to start thinking about the moment to taper.
