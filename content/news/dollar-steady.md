## Overview

Indeed, most of the G10 currencies have experienced little volatility to start the week and a gauge for Dollar volatility fell to a 15-month low. The Dollar Index is near a five-month low.

Last week’s economic data was nearly all positive, but not spectacular, which will likely allow the Federal Reserve to keep its current policy in place a touch longer. If the Fed remains dovish, that could spell medium-term dollar weakness. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary and Former Fed chief Janet Yellen said that higher interest rates would be a “plus” for the U.S. and the Fed. Of course, Yellen no longer works for the Fed and is currently trying to sell President Biden’s infrastructure deal, but her words carry great weight for those following monetary policy.

There is no major data on today’s docket. For those looking for volatility, look to the USD/MXN pair.
