## Overview

Unfortunately, there is disillusion with the slowdown in vaccination rates and the sluggish distribution in even the more advanced countries that were once doing fine such as Australia. Meanwhile, infections are up, valuations for plenty of things seem way too high, and after spending with enthusiasm following the worst of COVID consumers are now worried about the environment for big-ticket purchases such as vehicles as well as homes.

**Nevertheless, volatility remains as now the reflation trade seems to be cooled off. While some countries seem to be making progress, others seem to be regressing, thus no clarity about how and when as a globe we will overcome this pandemic.** The Olympics held with no global fans whatsoever are a clear example that we have plenty of ways to go. At the same time, earnings are impressing so some traders wonder if the doubts surrounding the economy will fade away soon. Expect these weeks until September, a pivotal time for re-openings and activity when we can gauge if real progress had been made.
