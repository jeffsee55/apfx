## Overview

The U.S. dollar is holding on to its impressive gains seen since Wednesday afternoon and the Bloomberg Dollar Index is at a two-month high.

There is no economic data on today’s docket. However, the dollar is seeing some early strength as Fed policymaker James Bullard speaks. The headline that is likely driving the pop in the dollar is “Bullard says His Dot Reflects Liftoff in 2022”. Bullard also said that Fed Chairman Powell officially opened taper discussion this week. Add his comments to the Fed’s hawkish stance this week.

Yesterday, President Joe Biden signed Juneteenth into law as a federal holiday celebrating the emancipation of African Americans who had been enslaved. Tempus will be honoring the day but because the holiday is not yet a “market holiday” we will have full coverage for clients until 5 pm EST, per a normal Friday.
