## Overview

Outside of the G10, the Mexican peso has risen to its strongest level against the U.S. dollar in five months. While the greenback gained to start the week, global markets, in general, have been fairly quiet. The 10-year Treasury yield fell back below 1.5% for the first time since early May, but equities markets have only shrugged.

With the economic docket remaining light today, the focus appears to be on tomorrow’s inflation report. The Consumer price index is due out at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow and could spark volatility that has been lacking in the currency markets this month. Economists expect that prices climbed 4.7% in May from a year earlier. That would be the quickest pace since 2008. It is important to note that the number will appear high due to the “base effect” since the yearly number will include the beginning of the pandemic. Regardless, traders will use the inflation print to start predicting when the Federal Reserve will start tapering its bond-buying program.
